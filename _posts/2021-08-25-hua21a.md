title: Learning Input Strictly Local Functions From Their Composition
abstract: This paper studies the learning of two functions given positive samples
  of their composition, motivated by an empirical problem in natural language phonology.  Empirically
  relevant conditions under which this is possible are identified and a provably correct
  algorithm is given that can <em>semi-strongly</em> identify the two functions in
  polynomial time and data. In order to clearly illustrate the learning problem and
  related concepts, we focus on a simple subset of <em>input strictly 2-local functions</em>.  But
  we further argue that the general learning procedure we propose can be extended
  to more general classes of functions.
