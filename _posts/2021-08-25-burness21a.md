title: Learning Multiple Independent Tier-based Processes
abstract: Work on the learnability of tier-based string-to-string functions has so
  far been limited to those that operate over a single tier. Such functions are, however,
  generally incapable of modelling multiple simultaneous processes. It is relatively
  easy to define a class of multi-tiered functions that can handle more than one process
  at a time, but doing so has negative consequences for learnability. Namely, we conjecture
  that it is difficult if not impossible to efficiently learn any arbitrary set of
  tiers from positive data alone. We thus describe the <em>strongly target-specified</em>
  subclass of multi-tiered functions, whose tiers can be efficiently identified from
  positive data. In these functions, each input element is associated with a single
  tier that on its own can fully determine what the element is mapped to. When the
  tiers act independently in this way, we can learn them in isolation from each other.
  A transducer representation of the target function can then be constructed using
  the discovered tiers.
