title: Query Learning Algorithm for Symbolic Weighted Finite Automata
abstract: We propose a query learning algorithm for an extension of weighted finite
  automata (WFAs), named symbolic weighted finite automata (SWFAs), which can handle
  strings over infinite alphabets more efficiently. Based on the idea of symbolic
  finite automata, SWFAs generalize WFAs by allowing transitions to be functions from
  a possibly infinite alphabet to weights. Our algorithm can learn SWFAs if functions
  in transitions are also learnable by queries. We also investigate minimization and
  equivalence checking for SWFAs.
