title: Extracting Context-Free Grammars from Recurrent Neural Networks using Tree-Automata
  Learning and A* Search
abstract: This paper presents (i) an active learning algorithm for visibly pushdown
  grammars and (ii) shows its applicability for learning surrogate models of recurrent
  neural networks (RNNs) trained on context-free languages.       Such surrogate models
  may be used for verification or explainability. Our learning algorithm makes use
  of the proximity of visibly pushdown languages and regular tree languages and builds
  on an existing learning algorithm for regular tree languages. Equivalence tests
  between a given RNN and a hypothesis grammar rely on a mixture of A* search and
  random sampling. An evaluation of our approach on a set of RNNs from the literature
  shows good preliminary results.
