title: Recognizing Long Grammatical Sequences using Recurrent Networks Augmented with
  an External Differentiable Stack
abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are widely used for sequence modeling,
  generation, and prediction. Despite success in applications such as machine translation
  and voice recognition, these stateful models have several critical shortcomings.
  Specifically, RNNs struggle to recognize very long sequences, which limits their
  applicability in many important temporal processing and time series forecasting
  problems. For example, RNNs struggle in recognizing complex context free languages
  (CFLs), unable to reach 100% accuracy on the training set. One way to address these
  shortcomings is to couple an RNN with an external, differentiable memory structure,
  such as a stack. However, differentiable memories in prior work have neither been
  extensively studied on complex CFLs nor tested on very long sequences that have
  been seen on training. In fact, earlier work has shown that continuous differentiable
  memory structures struggle in recognizing complex CFLs over very long sequences.
  In this paper, we improve the memory-augmented RNN with new architectural and state
  updating mechanisms that learn to properly balance the use of latent states with
  external memory. Our improved RNN models exhibit improved generalization and are
  able to classify long strings generated by complex hierarchical context free grammars
  (CFGs). We evaluate our models on CFGs, including the Dyck languages, as well as
  on the Penn Treebank language modelling dataset,  achieving stable, robust performance
  on these benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that our proposed memory-augmented networks
  are able retain information over long sequences leading to improved generalization
  for strings up to length $160$.
