title: Inside-Outside Algorithm for Macro Grammars
abstract: We propose an inside-outside algorithm for stochastic macro grammars. Our
  approach is based on types, which has been inspired by type-based approaches to
  reasoning about functional programs and higher-order grammars. By considering type
  derivations instead of ordinary word derivation sequences, we can naturally extend
  the standard inside-outside algorithm for stochastic context-free grammars to obtain
  the algorithm for stochastic macro grammars. We have implemented the algorithm and
  confirmed its effectiveness through an application to the learning of macro grammars.
