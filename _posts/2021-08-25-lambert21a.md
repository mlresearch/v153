title: Grammar Interpretations and Learning TSL Online
abstract: 'The tier-based strictly local ($\TSL{}$) languages are a class of formal
  languages that, alongside the strictly piecewise class, effectively model some long-distance
  generalizations in natural language (Heinz et al., 2011). Two learning algorithms
  for $\TSL{}$ already exist: one by Jardine and Heinz (2016) and one by Jardine and
  McMullin (2017). The former is limited in that it cannot learn all $\TSL{}$ patterns.
  The latter is restricted to a batch-learning environment. We present a general algorithm
  without these limitations. In particular we show that $\TSL{}$ is efficiently learnable
  online via reinterpretation of a strictly local grammar, and this mechanism generalizes
  to the strictly piecewise class as well. However we note that the known $\TSL{}$
  learning algorithms are not robust in the face of interaction with other constraints,
  posing a challenge for the utility of this class for phonotactics.'
