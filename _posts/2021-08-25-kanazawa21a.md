title: A Hierarchy of Context-Free Languages Learnable from Positive Data and Membership
  Queries
abstract: 'We consider a generalization of the “dual” approach to distributional learning
  of context-free grammars, where each nonterminal $A$ is associated with a string
  set $X_A$ characterized by a finite set $C$ of contexts. Rather than letting $X_A$
  be the set of all strings accepted by all contexts in $C$ as in previous works,
  we allow more flexible uses of the contexts in $C$, using some of them positively
  (contexts that accept the strings in $X_A$) and others negatively (contexts that
  do not accept any strings in $X_A$). The resulting more general algorithm works
  in essentially the same way as before, but on a larger class of context-free languages. '
