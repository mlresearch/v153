title: Extracting Weighted Automata for Approximate Minimization in Language Modelling
abstract: In this paper we study the approximate minimization problem for language
  modelling.  We assume we are given some language model as a black box. The objective
  is to obtain a weighted finite automaton (WFA) that fits within a given size constraint
  and which mimics the behaviour of the original model while minimizing some notion
  of distance between the black box and the extracted WFA. We provide an algorithm
  for the approximate minimization of black boxes trained for language modelling of
  sequential data over a one-letter alphabet. By reformulating the problem in terms
  of Hankel matrices, we leverage classical results on the approximation of Hankel
  operators, namely the celebrated Adamyan-Arov-Krein (AAK) theory. This allows us
  to use the spectral norm to measure the distance between the black box and the WFA.
  We provide theoretical guarantees to study the potentially infinite-rank Hankel
  matrix of the black box, without accessing the training data, and we prove that
  our method returns an asymptotically-optimal approximation.
