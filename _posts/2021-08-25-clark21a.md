title: 'Beyond Chomsky Normal Form: Extending Strong Learning Algorithms for PCFGs'
abstract: We extend a recent consistent strong learning algorithm for a subclass of
  probabilistic context-free grammars in Chomsky normal form, (Clark and Fijalkow,
  2020) to a much larger class of grammars by weakening the normal form constraints
  to allow for a richer class of derivation structures that are not necessarily binary
  branching,  including among other possibilities unary branching trees which introduce
  some technical difficulties. By modifying the structural conditions appropriately
  we obtain an algorithm which is computationally efficient, and a consistent estimator
  for the class of grammars defined.
